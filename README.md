♦ Chapter - 1: Basic
console.log(), variables, comments, operators, first js app

1. variables - are placeholders to store info and data in your app, refers to the value stroed in it (var name ='Alice') (var has 2 sides: reference(name), value(Alice)) tip - give descriptive name to var
2. comment - read only
3. operators - used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations

prompt() - built in js functionality that helps you get i/p from a user through the browser

Try to make the app dynamic by saving the user i/p in a variable. Hint: use prompt()

you can interact with your built in console like if it was your editor. you can run snippets of code in your console to test it instantly, without running your app.

alert() is like prompt(), but it is only for output

♦ Chapter - 2: Baby Weather App:
Data Types, Build a weather app

Data Types - any kind of number, including decimals
♦String - zero or more chara written inside quotes

Math.floor() - rounds a num down to the nearest integer and returns the result.
Math.ceil() - rounds a num up to the nearest int and returns the result.
Math.random() - returns a random num btw 0(inclusive) and 1(exclusive)

How do you turn a random num like 2.73059 into the closest loewr int?

Variables: var let const
dont use var its outdated
const - value cant be changed
let - value can be changed
var - value can be changed, not recommended

Conditionals: are used in statements to compare variables, values and/or data types. they always return a bool- true or false

♦ Chapter-3: Functions
Function, Dynamic functions, Tip Calculator App

Function: Block of Code designed to perform a particular task and it is executed when "something" calls it.

return statements makes the function reusable. you can use the same function in multiple places

arrow functions: allow us to write shorter function syntax

a function is returning implicitly if it doesnt use the return method
☻Try to sue arrow functions

♦ Chapter - 4: Arrays:
Arrays, Dynamic Functions, Tip Calculator App, Basics of Arrays

Array: allows you to store mul val inside of them

Chapter - 5: Objects:
Objects: are type of var, quite similar to arr but they have something called key-value pairs (property is just one of the key-val pairs)

Chapter - 6: Method:
Method: is a property containing a func def

Chapter - 7: For Loop:
For Loop: control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly
Function: create a fun that adds all the no in arr

Chapter - 8: Array Methods(HoF):
map(), filter(), reduce()
